This IOS application seeks to provide an enhanced way for fraternities and sororites to communicate. There are a few functionality applications that need to be added before the application can be pushed to the app store. 

Please allow ample time for the application to open and load as it must download some package dependencies. It will download these on their own but just takes time.
